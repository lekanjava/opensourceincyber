# About OpenSourceInCyber

OpenSourceInCyber was founded with a clear mission: to democratize cybersecurity by making enterprise-grade security tools and knowledge accessible to businesses of all sizes, with a special focus on supporting African startups and emerging businesses worldwide.

## Our Story

Born from the recognition that cybersecurity resources are often out of reach for small businesses and startups, especially in developing regions, we set out to bridge this gap. Our team of security professionals, developers, and educators came together to create a platform that leverages the power of open source to provide robust security solutions without the prohibitive costs.

## What We Believe

- **Security is a Right, Not a Privilege**: Every business deserves access to tools and knowledge that can protect their digital assets
- **Open Source is the Great Equalizer**: Collaborative, community-driven security tools can match or exceed proprietary solutions
- **Knowledge Sharing is Essential**: Education and transparency are critical components of effective security
- **Local Context Matters**: Security solutions must be adaptable to regional challenges and constraints

## Our Approach

We curate, document, and provide implementation guidance for open source security tools across the entire security spectrum. Our platform offers:

- Detailed documentation on tool selection and implementation
- Step-by-step tutorials tailored to different business needs
- Community forums for peer support and knowledge exchange
- Direct assistance for businesses facing resource constraints

## Join Our Mission

Whether you're a security professional looking to contribute your expertise, a business seeking to improve your security posture, or an advocate for digital safety, we welcome you to join our community and help make cybersecurity accessible to all.
