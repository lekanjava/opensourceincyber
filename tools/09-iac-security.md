# Open Source Infrastructure as Code Security Tools

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) enables organizations to manage infrastructure through code, but it also introduces security risks. These open source tools help you secure your infrastructure definitions and deployments.

## Recommended Tools

### Static Analysis for IaC

#### Checkov

- **Key Features**: Scans Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, Dockerfile, and ARM templates
- **Best For**: Organizations using multiple IaC frameworks who need comprehensive security scanning
- **Installation Guide**: [Checkov Documentation](https://www.checkov.io/1.Welcome/Quick%20Start.html)
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov](https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov)

#### TFSec
- **Description**: A security scanner for Terraform code
- **Key Features**: Checks for potential security issues, misconfigurations, and best practice violations
- **Best For**: Organizations using Terraform who need specialized security scanning
- **Installation Guide**: [TFSec Documentation](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec#installation)

### Policy as Code

#### Open Policy Agent (OPA)
- **Description**: A policy engine that enables policy-based control for cloud infrastructure
- **Key Features**: Policy as code, flexible policy definition, and integration with IaC tools

#### Conftest
- **Description**: A utility to write tests against structured configuration data
- **Key Features**: Testing against Kubernetes configurations, Terraform plans, and other structured data
- **Best For**: Organizations looking to validate configurations against policy
- **Installation Guide**: [Conftest Documentation](https://www.conftest.dev/install/)
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest)

### Secure Configuration Management

#### SOPS (Secrets OPerationS)
- **Description**: A tool for encrypting and decrypting secrets in configuration files
- **Key Features**: Integration with cloud KMS, PGP, and age for encryption

### Compliance as Code

#### InSpec
- **Description**: A framework for testing and auditing infrastructure
- **Key Features**: Human-readable compliance code, extensible resources, and multi-platform support
- **Best For**: Organizations implementing compliance checks for infrastructure
- **Installation Guide**: [InSpec Documentation](https://docs.chef.io/inspec/)
- **GitHub**: [https://github.com/inspec/inspec](https://github.com/inspec/inspec)

## Implementation Guidance

1. **Shift Left**: Integrate IaC security scanning early in the development process
2. **Version Control**: Store IaC files in version-controlled repositories
3. **Secure Secrets**: Never store plaintext secrets in IaC files
4. **Consistent Policies**: Apply consistent security policies across all infrastructure definitions
5. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing for IaC security as part of CI/CD pipelines
