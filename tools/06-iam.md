## Implementation Guidance

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users only the access they need to perform their job functions
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement MFA for all privileged accounts and sensitive systems
3. **Regular Reviews**: Conduct periodic access reviews to identify and remove unnecessary privileges
4. **Centralized Management**: Use centralized IAM solutions for consistent policy enforcement
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring of authentication and authorization events
