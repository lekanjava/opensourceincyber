## Implementation Guidance

1. **Secure Base Images**: Start with minimal, trusted base images and keep them updated
2. **Shift Left**: Implement container security scanning early in the development process
3. **Immutable Containers**: Treat containers as immutable and avoid runtime changes
4. **Least Privilege**: Run containers with minimal required permissions and capabilities
5. **Network Segmentation**: Implement network policies to control container communication
